TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 
Any browser. Any host. Any OS. Open source. even then TypeScript is a free and open source programming language developed by Microsoft to improve and secure the production of JavaScript code. It is a superset of JavaScript (i.e. any correct JavaScript code can be used with TypeScript). TypeScript code is transcompiled into JavaScript, and can thus be interpreted by any web browser or JavaScript engine. TypeScript was co-created by Anders Hejlsberg, the main inventor of C#.
